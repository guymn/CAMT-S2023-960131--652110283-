    <h1>What is an article?</h1>
    <p>
        An article is a word that is used to indicate that a noun is a noun without describing it. 
        For example, in the sentence Nick bought a dog, the article a indicates that the word dog is a noun. 
        Articles can also modify anything that acts as a noun, <u>such as a pronoun or a noun phrase.</u>

        of times that we use them. These three words belong to a class of words known as articles. If you want to
